Here's a Java program for a simple guessing game. The program generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it, providing feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, and it then displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.
Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using Random.nextInt(100) + 1.
User Input: The program uses the Scanner class to read user input.
Game Loop: A while loop runs until the user correctly guesses the number.
Feedback and Attempts: The program provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts.
Winning Condition: When the user guesses correctly, the loop exits, and the program displays a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts.
This program is a fun way to practice using loops, conditionals, random number generation, and basic user input/output in Java.
